Remix [espurna-h PCB](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna-board)

I didn't need current metering HLW8012, however needed an increase in reliability.

I used the [xoseperez](https://github.com/xoseperez) design to make the board using the Watch Dog hardware.

Changes:
- Added hardware Watch Dog STMicroelectronics STWD100. It is possible to use pin-to-pin analogs. Pin Enable has 2 pull-up options. Disconnection by a jumper.
- 3mm mounting holes (Little space, but dimensions are preserved).
- Slightly changed the layout of the board, redrawn all the tracks of the PCB.
- More GPIOs brought out.
